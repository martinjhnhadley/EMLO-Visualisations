# CRUK Oxford Network

This case study is the result of a collaboration between the Live Data project team and the CRUK Oxford Centre on a project to visualise and facilitate interdepartmental collaborations between cancer researchers at the University of Oxford. 

An alpha-build Shiny app is currently in development, a screenshot of which is included here. It is hoped that a publically available visualisation will be made available in the near future.
