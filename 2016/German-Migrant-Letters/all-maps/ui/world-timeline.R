The project is funded through the Leverhulme Trust (Ref-No RPG-338) and based at the University of Oxford, Department of Politics and International Relations. The research 
       conducted by Gwendolyn Sasse and Félix Krawatzek uses a total collection of 6,000 letters sent between the US and Germany between around 1830 and 1970. Permission to use the 
       collection has been granted by Prof. Ursula Lehmkuhl, University of Trier, and the Research Library Gotha.

       "<p>The right-hand side column displays the different places from which letters of a particular series were sent. You can unselect any single or multiple series by clicking on 
       the name of the series. You can also get an understanding of the frequency of letters over time by clicking the above “Filter letters by date sent”. 
       An article in “The Converstaion” (HYPERLINK) allows you to gain some insight into the research linked to this visualisation.
