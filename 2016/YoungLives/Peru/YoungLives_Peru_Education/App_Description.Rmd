The visualization shows education indicators for different groups of children at the age of 12. Children are grouped by gender, location, mothers first language and by other individual or household circumstances, based on information collected earlier in their lives. Since information is available at the same ages on two cohorts growing up in the same communities but born 7 years apart, the charts show how circumstances have changed for the cohorts between 2006 and 2013.


99% of 12 year olds were reported as enrolled in school in 2013, which was similar to the enrolment rate in 2016. Around a third of children in the younger cohort were making slower than expected grade progression in 2013 (ie they were over-age for their grade). Children in the younger cohort were less likely to be over age than the older cohort which suggests an improvement over time. There are clear ongoing inequalities in who is making most and least progress at school. Children in rural areas, the poorest children, those whose mothers language was not Spanish and whose mother had lower levels of education were the most likely to be over over-age. 


Overall between the cohorts there has been a slight improvement on a simple test of maths questions. As with the patterns for who is overage for their grade, there are large differences in performance between groups. Those whose average scores tended to be higher included children in urban areas, with Spanish speaking mothers, with more educated mothers, and from less poor backgrounds. The performance gaps between boys and girls are smaller than those by household background but boys did slightly better in these tests than girls. The disaggregation shown on the visualisation are slightly different to those within the linked factsheet. Consequently not all of the patterns are comparable.
