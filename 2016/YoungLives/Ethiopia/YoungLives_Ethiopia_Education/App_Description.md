The visualization shows education indicators for different groups of children at the age of 12. Children are grouped by gender, location and by other individual or household circumstances, based on information collected earlier in their lives. Since information is available at the same ages on two cohorts growing up in the same communities but born 7 years apart, the charts show how circumstances have changed for the cohorts between 2006 and 2013.

95% of 12 year olds were reported as enrolled in school in 2013. Those most likely to be enrolled were in urban areas, growing up in the capital, Addis Ababa, or to be from households with higher wealth or maternal education levels. Those least likely to be enrolled were in rural areas and to be in households with lower wealth or maternal education levels. 

Children growing up in urban areas, from households with higher material wealth or maternal education had all made the fastest grade progression in school and were most likely to get maths test questions correct. There was very little difference at this age in the highest grade or maths test between boys and girls. 

Between the cohorts, enrolment rates did not change, the highest grade completed increased slightly but there was worrying evidence with fewer children able to answer similar maths questions in the younger cohort than the older cohort were.
