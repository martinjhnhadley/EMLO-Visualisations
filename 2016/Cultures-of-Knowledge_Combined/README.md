# Cultures of Knowledge

This case study is the result of a collaboration between the Live Data project team and [Culture of Knowlege](http://www.culturesofknowledge.org/) to visualise a subset of 1695 individuals correspondances from the <a href="http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/">Early Modern Letters Online</a> (EMLO) repository.

A beta Shiny app is currently in development, a screenshot of which is included here. It is hoped that a publically available visualisation will be made available in the near future.
