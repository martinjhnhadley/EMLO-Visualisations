# Online Labour Index

This Live Data case study is the result of a collaboration between the Live Data project team and both Otto Kässi and Vili Lehdonvirta from the Oxford Internet Institue to visualise data collected from various "online gig economies" for the [iLabour Project](http://ilabour.oii.ox.ac.uk/).

The visualisation was developed using Shiny and will be made available here shortly, note that the underlying data is available here: https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3761562.v3

Should you have questions about the project or wish to find out more about this dataset, please contact the [project team](http://ilabour.oii.ox.ac.uk/project-team/)
