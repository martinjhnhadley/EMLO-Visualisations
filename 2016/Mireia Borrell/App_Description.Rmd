This section provides an interactive exploration of the policies included in our database. 

<strong>How to get the most out of it</strong>

<div style="text-decoration: underline;font-style: italic;">Timeline visualisation:</div>

<div style="font-style: italic;">What does it provide?</div>

<ul>
<li>The timeline tab provides a chronological visualisation of the policies.</li>

<li>These ones are categorized in three types of policies differentiated by colours.</li>

<li>The user can choose to see different combinations of policies according to their categorization, and the timeline can be downloaded as a picture, and zoomed in and out using the set of buttons on the left hand side of the timeline.</li>

<li>By clicking on any one row of policy (on the black lines), the details of the policies will be shown below in a table.</li>

<li>The user can: add more details (columns) by clicking on ‘columns to show’; filter the information shown using the filters provided below the headers of the columns (e.g. filter year, dates…).</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-style:italic;">What does it not provide?</div>

<ul>
<li>Within this timeline visualisation, the user cannot: see more than one policy (e.g. maternity leave and paternity leave) or all policies at once. For this, the user is referred to the tab ‘All policies’, or to the ‘download’ option above (.xlsx).</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-decoration: underline;font-style:italic;">All policies visualisation</div>
