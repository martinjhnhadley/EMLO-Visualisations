This application allows for the exploration of data published by David Zeitlyn and Daniel Hook on intellectual genealogies: the networks created by PhD defense/ examination, advisory and supervisory relationships in the field of primatology.. The supervisory network has one connected component containing 67% of the individuals in the network, consequently there is one mode of interaction for the largest connected component (or lineage) and another for all other lineages.
