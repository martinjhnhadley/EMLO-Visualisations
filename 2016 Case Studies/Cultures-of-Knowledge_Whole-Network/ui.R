## ==== Packages to load for server

library(shiny) # Some advanced functionality depends on the shiny package being loaded client-side, including plot.ly
library(visNetwork)
library(networkD3)
library(lubridate)
library(shinyBS)
library(htmltools) # Need for htmlDependency used by custom date picker

## ==== Global Variables (client-side)

library(shinythemes) # Template uses the cerulean theme as it is pretty

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  ## ==== Include google analytics code
  tags$head(includeScript("google-analytics.js")),
  
  ## ==== Automatically include vertical scrollbar
  ## ==== This prevents the app from reloading content when the window is resized which would otherwise result in the
  ## ==== appearance of the scrollbar and the reloading of content. Note that "click data" may still be lost during
  ## ==== resizing, as discussed here https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/937
