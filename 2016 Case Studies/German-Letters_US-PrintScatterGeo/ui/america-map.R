         The project is funded through the Leverhulme Trust (Ref-No RPG-338) and based at the University of Oxford, Department of Politics and International Relations. The research 
         conducted by Gwendolyn Sasse and Félix Krawatzek uses a total collection of 6,000 letters sent between the US and Germany between around 1830 and 1970. Permission to use the 
         collection has been granted by Prof. Ursula Lehmkuhl, University of Trier, and the Research Library Gotha.
